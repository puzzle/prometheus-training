### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Create a ServiceMonitor

**Task description**:

Create a ServiceMonitor  for the example application

* Create a ServiceMonitor, which will configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the example-web-python application every 30 seconds.
  * hint: `kubectl -n application-metrics apply -f my_file.yaml` will create a resource in the Kubernetes namespace

For this to work properly make sure:

* The example-web-python service is labeled correctly and matches the labels you've defined in your ServiceMonitor.
* The port name in your ServiceMonitor configuration matches the port name in the service definition.
  * hint: check with `kubectl get service example-web-python -n application-metrics -o yaml`
* Verify the target in the Prometheus user interface

{{% alert title="Best-practice: Troubleshoot when metrics are not scraped" color="primary" %}}

Does the config of the ServiceMonitor appear in the Prometheus scrape config?

* Check if the label of your ServiceMonitor matches the label defined in the Prometheus custom resource
* Check the Prometheus operator logs, if there are not allowed fields defined

The endoint appears in the Prometheus scrape config but not under targets. The service discovery can't find the endpoint.

* The namespaceSelector in the ServiceMonitor does not match the namespace of your app
* The label selector does not match the service of your app
* The port name does not match the service of your app

No data gets scraped

* The application does not provide metrics under the correct path and port
* Networking issues
* Authentication required, but not configured

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

Create the following service monitor (`~/work/servicemonitor.yaml`) in the `application-metrics` namespace

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/08/labs/servicemonitor.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

Apply it using the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n application-metrics apply -f ~/work/servicemonitor.yaml
```

Verify that the target gets scraped in the [Prometheus user interface](http://LOCALHOST:19090/targets). Target name: `application-metrics/example-web-python-monitor/0`

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Deploy a database and use a sidecar container to expose metrics

**Task description**:

As we've learned in [Lab 4 - Prometheus exporters](../../../04/) when applications do not expose metrics in the Prometheus format, there are a lot of exporters available to convert metrics into the correct format. In Kubernetes this is often done by deploying so called sidecar containers along with the actual application.

Use the following command to deploy a MariaDB database in the `application-metrics` namespace.

```bash
curl -o ~/work/mariadb.yaml \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/prometheus-training/main/content/en/docs/08/labs/mariadb.yaml
kubectl -n application-metrics apply -f ~/work/mariadb.yaml
```

This will create a [secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) (username password to access the database), a [service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) and the [deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

* Deploy the [mariadb exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter) from <https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/prom/mysqld-exporter/> as a sidecar container
  * Alter the existing MariaDB deployment definition (~/work/mariadb.yaml) to contain the side car
  * Apply your changes to the cluster with `kubectl -n application-metrics apply -f ~/work/mariadb.yaml`
* Create a ServiceMonitor to instruct Prometheus to scrape the sidecar container

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

First we need to alter the deployment of the MariaDB with adding the MariaDB exporter as a second container.
Then extend the service by adding a second port for the MariaDB exporter.

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/08/labs/mariadb-sidecar.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

We can apply the file above using `kubectl -n application-metrics apply -f ~/work/mariadb.yaml`

Then we also need to create a new service monitor `~/work/servicemonitor-sidecar.yaml`.

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/08/labs/servicemonitor-sidecar.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

`kubectl -n application-metrics apply -f ~/work/servicemonitor-sidecar.yaml`

Verify that the target gets scraped in the [Prometheus user interface](http://LOCALHOST:19090/targets). Target name: `application-metrics/mariadb/0`

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.:3 Blackbox monitoring in Kubernetes (optional)

In [Lab 4 - Prometheus exporters](../../../04/) we came across the blackbox exporter and learned how to configure a multi-target exporter using somewhat difficult to understand relabel_configs.

The CoreOS Prometheus Operator brings us a so called probe custom resource, which allows us to easily define the targets for a blackbox exporter.

**Task description**:

* Create a [probe custom resource](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/design.md#probe) in the application-metrics namespace for the example-web-python application
* Use the Prometheus expression browser to check if the new metric is being scraped

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}

Use `kubectl describe crd probe | less` to describe the crd and get the available options.

{{% /alert %}}

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

Create the following probe custom resource (`~/work/probe.yaml`) in the `application-metrics` namespace

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/08/labs/probe.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

Apply it using the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n application-metrics apply -f ~/work/probe.yaml
```

Verify that the target gets scraped in the [Prometheus user interface](http://LOCALHOST:19090/targets). Target name: `application-metrics/example-web-python-probe`

Check for the following metric in Prometheus:

```promql
{instance="example-web-python.application-metrics.svc:5000/health"}
```
