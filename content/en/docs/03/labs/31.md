{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
This setup is only suitable for our lab environment. In real life, you must consider how to monitor your monitoring infrastructure:
Having an Alertmanager instance as an Alertmanager AND as a target in the same Prometheus is a bad idea!
{{% /alert %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1

This is repetition: Alertmanager also exposes metrics which can be scraped by Prometheus

* Configure the metric endpoint of Alertmanager in Prometheus

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2

* Query one specific metric of Alertmanager

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3

* Query all metrics which are exposed by Alertmanager

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.4

* How many minutes ago was the last successful configuration reload of Alertmanager?

### Next step

Continue with the [configuration in Alertmanager](../../#configuration-in-alertmanager).

## Solutions

{{% details title="Task 1" %}}

Configure a new job under `scrape_configs` in `prometheus.yml`:
```yaml
  - job_name: 'alertmanager'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9093']
```

Reload Prometheus
```bash
killall -HUP prometheus
```


{{% /details %}}


{{% details title="Task 2" %}}

To find out which metrics are available for one service you might query its metrics endpoint with `curl`, e.g. for Alertmanager:

```bash
curl localhost:9093/metrics
```

Then you get all metrics as follows (shortened), and you can pick whatever you're interested in:

```
# HELP alertmanager_alerts How many alerts by state.
# TYPE alertmanager_alerts gauge
alertmanager_alerts{state="active"} 0
alertmanager_alerts{state="suppressed"} 0
# HELP alertmanager_alerts_invalid_total The total number of received alerts that were invalid.
# TYPE alertmanager_alerts_invalid_total counter
alertmanager_alerts_invalid_total{version="v1"} 0
alertmanager_alerts_invalid_total{version="v2"} 0
# HELP alertmanager_alerts_received_total The total number of received alerts.
# TYPE alertmanager_alerts_received_total counter
alertmanager_alerts_received_total{status="firing",version="v1"} 0
alertmanager_alerts_received_total{status="firing",version="v2"} 0
alertmanager_alerts_received_total{status="resolved",version="v1"} 0
alertmanager_alerts_received_total{status="resolved",version="v2"} 0
...
```
{{% /details %}}

{{% details title="Task 3" %}}

Execute a query in the Prometheus web UI without a metric name, but with labels only:
```promql
{job="alertmanager"}
```
{{% /details %}}

{{% details title="Task 4" %}}

```promql
(time() - alertmanager_config_last_reload_success_timestamp_seconds) / 60
```
{{% /details %}}
