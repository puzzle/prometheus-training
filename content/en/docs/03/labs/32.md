{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
We provide a training app which simulates a webhook receiver. This simulation just prints the alerts it gets. Before we go on, we must install the training app and start the webook receiver:

```bash
cd ~/downloads
curl -L -O https://github.com/acend/prometheus-training-app/releases/download/v0.0.5/prometheus-training-app_0.0.5_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
mkdir ~/work/prometheus-training-app_0.0.5_Linux_x86_64 && tar fvxz prometheus-training-app_0.0.5_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -C $_
cd ~/work/prometheus-training-app_0.0.5_Linux_x86_64
./prometheus-training-app webhook &
```

The URL of this webhook receiver is `http://localhost:5001/`.
{{% /alert %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Send a test alert

In this taks you can use the [amtool](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager#amtool) command to send a test alert.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

To send a test alert with the labels `alername=UP` and `node=bar` you can simply execute the following command.

```bash
amtool alert add --alertmanager.url=http://localhost:9093 alertname=Up node=bar
```

Check in the [Alertmanger web UI](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.alertmanager %}}) if you see the test alert with the correct labels set.

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Add a webhook receiver

You can use the [amtool](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager#amtool) to validate your configuration and show your routing configuration.

Check the configuration:

```bash
amtool check-config /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
```

```bash
Checking '/etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml'  SUCCESS
Found:
 - global config
 - route
 - 1 inhibit rules
 - 1 receivers
 - 1 templates
  SUCCESS
```

Show routing tree:

```bash
amtool config routes --config.file /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
```

```bash
Routing tree:
.
└── default-route  receiver: web.hook
```

**Task description**:

* Configure an additional receiver `receiver-a` which notifies webhook `http://127.0.0.1:5001`
* Define a route so that `receiver-a` is notified when the label `team=team-a` is set
* Use `amtool` to test your routing configuration

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

Add the receiver and the route in `/etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml`:

```yaml
...
receivers:
- name: web.hook
  webhook_configs:
  - url: http://127.0.0.1:5001/
- name: receiver-a
  webhook_configs:
  - url: http://127.0.0.1:5001/
...
route:
  ...
  routes:
  - receiver: 'receiver-a'
    matchers:
    - team = "team-a"
...
```

Check that `receiver-a` gets notified, when the label `team=team-a` is set:

```bash
amtool config routes test --config.file /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml team=team-a
```

```bash
receiver-a
```

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3: Add an additional mail receiver

Alertmanger also supports to send mails. See [<email_config>](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#email_config) for a configuration example. To troubleshoot your configuration, e.g. if you cannot receive mails, it may be worthwhile to have a look at the Alertmanager logs.

```bash
sudo journalctl -u alertmanager
```

Additionally, it is possible to use regex to match labels in the routing configuration. To do so, we need to use `matchers` instead of the `match` keyword used in the task above. We recommend that you always use the `amtool` to test your routing configuration for complex alert routing.

**Task description**:

* Configure another receiver `receiver-b` to send a mail
  * from `prometheus@localhost`
  * to `alert@localhost`
  * SMTP Server `localhost:1025`
  * disable TLS
* Define two routes
  * The first route notifies `receiver-a` when the label `team=team-a` is set.
  * The second route notifies `receiver-b` when the label `team=team-a` **OR** `team=team-b` is set
  * Make sure that both receivers (A and B) are notified when the label `team=team-a` is set
* Send a test alert and verify the mails on mailcatcher `http://127.0.0.1:1080`
* Use amtool with both labels to test your routing configuration

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

In `/etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml` add the receiver and the routes.

```yaml
...
receivers:
- name: web.hook
  webhook_configs:
  - url: http://127.0.0.1:5001/
- name: receiver-a
  webhook_configs:
  - url: http://127.0.0.1:5001/
- name: receiver-b
  email_configs:
  - to: 'alert@localhost'
    from: 'prometheus@localhost'
    smarthost: 'localhost:1025'
    require_tls: false
...
route:
  ...
  routes:
  - receiver: 'receiver-a'
    matchers:
    - team = "team-a"
    continue: true
  - receiver: 'receiver-b'
    matchers:
      - team =~ "team-[a|b]"
...
```

Reload Alertmanager
```bash
sudo systemctl reload alertmanager.service
```

Use again `amtool` for checking your routing configuration:

```bash
amtool config routes --config.file /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
```

```bash
Routing tree:
.
└── default-route  receiver: web.hook
    ├── {team="team-a"}  continue: true  receiver: receiver-a
    └── {team=~"team-[a|b]"}  receiver: receiver-b
```

Add a test alert and check if the [mailcatcher](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.mailcatcher %}}) received the mail. It can take up to 5 minutes as the alarms are grouped together based on the [group_interval](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#route).

```bash
amtool alert add --alertmanager.url http://localhost:9093 alertname=test team=team-a
```

It is also advisable to validate the routing configuration against a test dataset to avoid unintended changes. With the option `--verify.receivers` the expected output can be specified:

```bash
amtool config routes test --config.file /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml --verify.receivers=receiver-a team=team-b
```

```bash
receiver-b
WARNING: Expected receivers did not match resolved receivers.
```

```bash
amtool config routes test --config.file /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml --verify.receivers=receiver-b team=team-b
```

```bash
receiver-b
```

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.4: Last successful Alertmanager configuration reload (optional)

Use PromQL to answer the following question: How many minutes ago was the last successful configuration reload of Alertmanager?

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```promql
(time() - alertmanager_config_last_reload_success_timestamp_seconds) / 60
```

* `time()` will return the current UNIX Epoch timestamp
* `alertmanager_config_last_reload_success_timestamp_seconds` will return the UNIX Epoch timetamp of the last successful Alertmanager configuration reload
* `/60` will calculate the result in minutes
