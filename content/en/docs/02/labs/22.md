In this lab you are going to learn a bit more about [PromQL (Prometheus Query Language)](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/).

PromQL is the query language that allows you to select, aggregate and filter the time series data collected by prometheus in real time.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
PromQL can seem overwhelming. It may take a little time to get used to it. There may be different approaches to solve the tasks. Our solution is just one possibility.
{{% /alert %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Explore Examples

In this first task you are going to explore some querying examples.

Get all time series with the metric `prometheus_http_requests_total`.

```promql
prometheus_http_requests_total
```

The result represents the time series for the http requests sent to your Prometheus server as an **instant vector**.

Get all time series with the metric `prometheus_http_requests_total` and the given `code` and `handler` labels.

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
prometheus_http_requests_total{code="200", handler="/api/v1/query"}
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

Additionally select your monitoring namespace using the `namespace` label.
```promql
prometheus_http_requests_total{code="200", handler="/api/v1/query",namespace="<team>-monitoring"}
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}


The result will show you the time series for the http requests sent to the query endpoint of your Prometheus Server, which were successful ( HTTP status code 200 ).

Get a whole range of time (5 minutes) for the same vector, making it a **range vector**:

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
prometheus_http_requests_total{code="200", handler="/api/v1/query"}[5m]
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

```promql
prometheus_http_requests_total{code="200", handler="/api/v1/query",namespace="<team>-monitoring"}[5m]
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

A range vector can not be graphed directly in the Prometheus UI, use the table view to display the result.

With regular expressions you can filter time series only for `handlers` whose name matches a certain pattern, in this case all `handlers` starting with `/api`:

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
prometheus_http_requests_total{handler=~"/api.*"}
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

```promql
prometheus_http_requests_total{handler=~"/api.*", namespace="<team>-monitoring"}
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

All regular expressions in Prometheus use the [RE2 syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).
To select all HTTP status codes except 2xx, you would execute:

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
prometheus_http_requests_total{code!~"2.."}
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

```promql
prometheus_http_requests_total{code!~"2..",namespace="<team>-monitoring"}
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Sum Aggregation Operator

The [Prometheus Aggregation operators](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#aggregation-operators) help us to aggregate time series in PromQL.

There is a Prometheus metric that represents all samples scraped  by Prometheus. Let's sum up the metrics returned.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

The metric `scrape_samples_scraped` represents the total of scraped samples by `job` and `instance`. To get the total amount of scraped samples, we use the [Prometheus aggregation operators](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#aggregation-operators) `sum` to sum the values.

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
sum(scrape_samples_scraped)
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

Additionally select your Prometheus instance using the `prometheus` label. Replace `<team>-monitoring/prometheus` with the monitoring name you defined earlier in lab 01.

```promql
sum(scrape_samples_scraped{prometheus="<team>-monitoring/prometheus"})
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3: Rate Function

Use the `rate()` function to display the current CPU **idle** usage per CPU core of the server in % based on data of the last 5 minutes.

{{% alert title="Hint" color="primary" %}}
Read the [documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/) about the `rate()` function.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

The CPU metrics are collected and exposed by the `node_exporter` therefore the metric we're looking for is under the `node` namespace.

```promql
node_cpu_seconds_total
```

To get the `idle` CPU seconds, we add the label filter `{mode="idle"}`.

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}
{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Select a specific node by filtering using the label `instance`. In our case and in the following examples, use `prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100` as a reference.
{{% /alert %}}
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

Since the `rate` function calculates the per-second average increase of the time series in a **range vector**, we have to pass a range vector to the function.

To get the idle usage in % we therefore have to multiply it with 100.

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
rate(
  node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m]
  )
* 100
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}
```promql
rate(
  node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"}[5m]
  )
* 100
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}


{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.4: Arithmetic Binary Operator

In the previous lab, we created a query that returns the CPU **idle** usage.
Now let's reuse that query to create a query that returns the current CPU usage per core of the server in %. The usage is the total (100%) [minus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#arithmetic-binary-operators) the CPU usage **idle**.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

To get the CPU usage we can simply substract **idle** CPU usage from 1 (100%) and then multiply it by 100 to get percentage.

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
(
  1 -
  rate(
      node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m]
      )
)
* 100
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}
```promql
(
  1 -
  rate(
      node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle",instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"}[5m]
      )
)
* 100
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.5: How much free memory

[Arithmetic Binary Operator](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#arithmetic-binary-operators) can not only be used with constant values `eg. 1`, it can also be used to evaluate to other instant vectors.

Write a Query that returns how much of the memory is free in %.

The `node exporter` exposes these two metrics:

* `node_memory_MemTotal_bytes`
* `node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes`

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

We can simply divide the available memory metric by the total memory of the node and multiply it by 100 to get percent.

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
sum by(instance) (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes)
/
sum by(instance) (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes)
* 100
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}
```promql
sum by(instance) (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes{instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"})
/
sum by(instance) (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"})
* 100
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.6: Comparison Binary Operators

In addition to the Arithmetic Binary Operator, PromQL also provides a set of [Comparison binary operators](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#comparison-binary-operators)

* `==` (equal)
* `!=` (not-equal)
* `>` (greater-than)
* `<` (less-than)
* `>=` (greater-or-equal)
* `<=` (less-or-equal)

Check if the server has more than 20% memory available using a [Comparison binary operators](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#comparison-binary-operators)

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

We can simply use the greater-than-binary operator to compare the instant vector from the query with 20 (In our case, this corresponds to 20% memory usage).


{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
sum by(instance) (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes)
/
sum by(instance) (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes)
* 100
> 20
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}
{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}
```promql
sum by(instance) (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes{instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"})
/
sum by(instance) (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"})
* 100
> 20
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

The query only has a result when more than 20% of the memory is available.

Change the value from 20 to 90 or more to see the result, when the operator doesn't match.

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.7: Histogram

So far we've been using gauge and counter metric types in our queries.

Read the [documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram) about the `histogram` metric type.

There exists a histogram for the http request durations to the Prometheus sever. It basically counts requests that took a certain amount of time and puts them into matching buckets (`le` label).

We want to write a query that returns

* the total numbers of requests
* to the Prometheus server
* on `/metrics`
* below 0.1 seconds

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

As seen in previous labs, the http metrics for the Prometheus server are available in the `prometheus` namespace.

By filtering the `le` label to 0.1 we get the result for our query.

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="/metrics",le="0.1"}
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

```promql
prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="/metrics",le="0.1",namespace="<team>-monitoring"}
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}


Tip: Analyze the query in [PromLens](https://demo.promlens.com/)

**Advanced:** You can calculate how many requests in % were below 0.1 seconds by aggregating above metric. See more information about Apdex score at [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/histograms/#apdex-score)

Example
{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
sum(
  rate(
    prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="/metrics",le="0.1"}[5m]
  )
) by (job, handler)
/
sum(
  rate(
    prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_count{handler="/metrics"}[5m]
  )
) by (job, handler)
* 100
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}


```promql
sum(
  rate(
    prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="/metrics",le="0.1",namespace="<team>-monitoring"}[5m]
  )
) by (job, handler)
/
sum(
  rate(
    prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_count{handler="/metrics",namespace="<team>-monitoring"}[5m]
  )
) by (job, handler)
* 100
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.8: Quantile

We can use the [histogram_quantile](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#histogram_quantile) function to calculate the request duration quantile of the requests to the Prometheus server from a histogram metric. To archive this we can use the metric `prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket`, which the Prometheus server exposes by default.

Write a query, that returns the per-second average of the 0.9th quantile under the `metrics` handler using the metric mentioned above.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

Expression

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
histogram_quantile(
  0.9,
  rate(
    prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="/metrics"}[5m]
  )
)
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}
{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

```promql
histogram_quantile(
  0.9,
  rate(
    prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="/metrics",namespace="<team>-monitoring"}[5m]
  )
)
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}


Explanation: `histogram_quantile` will calculate the 0.9 quantile based on the samples distribution in our buckets by assuming a linear distribution within a bucket.

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.9: predict_linear function (optional)

We could simply alert on static thresholds. For example, notify when the file system is more than 90% full. But sometimes 90% disk usage is a desired state. For example, if our volume is very large. (e.g. 10% of 10TB would still be 1TB free, who wants to waste that space?) So it is better to write queries based on predictions. Say, a query that tells me that my disk will be full within the next 24 hours if the growth rate is the same as the last 6 hours.

Let's write a query, that exactly makes such predictions:

* Find a metric that displays you the available disk space on filesystem mounted on `/`
* Use a function that allows you to predict when the filesystem will be full in 4 hours
* Predict the usage linearly based on the growth over the last 1 hour

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

Expression
{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
predict_linear(node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/"}[1h], 3600 * 4) < 0
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}
```promql
predict_linear(node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/",instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"}[1h], 3600 * 4) < 0
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

Explanation: based on data over the last `1h`, the disk will be `< 0` bytes in `3600 * 4` seconds.
The query will return `no data` because the file system will not be full in the next 4 hours. You can check how much disk space will be available in 4 hours by removing the `< 0` part.

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
predict_linear(node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/"}[1h], 3600 * 4)
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}
```promql
predict_linear(node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/",instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"}[1h], 3600 * 4)
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.10: Many-to-one vector matches (optional)

Prometheus provides built-in metrics that can be used to correlate their values with metrics exposed by your exporters. One such metric is `date()`.
Prometheus also allows you to add more labels from different metrics if you can correlate both metrics by labels. See [Many-to-one and one-to-many vector matches](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#many-to-one-and-one-to-many-vector-matches) for more examples.

Write a query that answers the following questions:

* What is the uptime of the server in minutes?
* Which kernel is currently active?

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

Expression

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
```promql
(
  (
    time() - node_boot_time_seconds
  ) / 60
)
* on(instance) group_left(release) node_uname_info
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}
```promql
(
  (
    time() - node_boot_time_seconds{instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"}
  ) / 60
)
* on(instance) group_left(release) node_uname_info
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}


* **time()**: Use the current UNIX Epoch time
* **node_boot_time_seconds**: Returns the UNIX epoch time at which the VM was started
* **on(instance) group_left(release) node_uname_info**: Group your metrics result with the metric `node_uname_info` which contains information about your kernel in the `release` label.

Alternative solution with `group_right` instead of `group_left` would be:
{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}

```promql
node_uname_info * on(instance) group_right(release)
(
  (
    time() - node_boot_time_seconds
  ) / 60
)
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}
```promql
node_uname_info{instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"} * on(instance) group_right(release)
(
  (
    time() - node_boot_time_seconds
  ) / 60
)
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}
{{% /details %}}
