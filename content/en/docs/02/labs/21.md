In this lab you are going to explore various metrics, which your Prometheus server is collecting.

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Prometheus web UI

Get a feel for how to use the Prometheus web UI. Open the [web UI](http://LOCALHOST:9090) and navigate to the **Graph** menu (right on top in the grey navigation bar next to Alerts).

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

![Prometheus UI](../prometheus-ui.png)

Let's start and find a memory related metric. The best way to start is by typing `node_memory` in the expression bar.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
As soon as you start typing a dropdown with matching metrics is shown.
{{% /alert %}}

You can also open the `Metrics Explorer` by clicking on the globe symbol next to the `Execute` button.

Select a metric such as `node_memory_MemFree_bytes` and click the `Execute` button.

The result of your first Query will be available under the two tabs:

1. Table
1. Graph

Explore those two views on your results. Shrink the time range in the Graph tab.

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Metric Prometheus server version

Prometheus collects its own metrics, so information such as the current build version of your Prometheus server is displayed as a metric.

Let's find a metric that shows you the version of your Prometheus server.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

Start typing `prometheus_...` in the expression browser, choose the `prometheus_build_info` metric and click the `Execute` Button.

Something similar to the following will be displayed

```promql
metricname                                  Value
prometheus_build_info{...,goversion="go1.15.5",instance="localhost:9090",job="prometheus",version="2.28.1"} 1
```

The actual Version of your Prometheus Server will be available as label `version`
```promql
{version="2.28.1"}
```

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3: Metric TCP sockets

Let's explore a `node exporter` metric in this lab.

1. Find a metric that shows you the number of TCP sockets in use
1. Display the number 5 minutes ago
1. Display the numbers in a graph over the last 15 minutes


{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

The node exporter metrics are all available in the `node` [namespace](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#metric-names).

The number of TCP sockets in use are available in the following metric.

```promql
node_sockstat_TCP_inuse
```

If you want to display the value 5 minutes ago, you'll have to add the correct timestamp in the **Evaluation time** field.

Switch to the **Graph** tab and change the value of the timepicker from `1h` to `15m` to display the graph over the last 15 minutes.

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.4: Metric network interfaces

Most virtual Linux machines nowadays have network interfaces. The `node exporter` you have enabled and configured in the previous lab also exposes metrics about network components.

Show all network interfaces where the device name starts with `eth`

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

The network interfaces are available in the following series:

```promql
node_network_info
```

The result includes all sorts of network interface. If you need to **filter** the result by a label you will have to alter your query:

```promql
node_network_info{device="eth0"}
```

But this will only show results for the exact `eth0` interface. The Task was to show all interfaces that start with `eth`.

In this case we have to use [Time series Selectors](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-series-selectors) to create a matching filter:

```promql
node_network_info{device=~"eth.*"}
```

There will be a lot more about queries and filtering in the next Labs
