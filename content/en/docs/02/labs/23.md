In this lab you are going to create your first own recording rules. [Recording rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/) are very useful when it comes to queries, which are very complex and take a long time to compute.
The naming convention dictates to use the following format when naming recording rules `level:metric:operation`. Additional information regarding naming best-practices can be found [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/rules/#naming-and-aggregation).

{{% alert title="Warning" color="secondary" %}}
Recording rules store the result in a new series and they can add additional complexity.

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Memory usage recording rule

With the following recording rule, we create a new metric that represents the available memory on a node as a percentage. A metric the `node exporter` doesn't expose when running on a machine with an older Linux kernel and needs to be calculated every time.

* Query the recording rule in the Prometheus web UI
{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
* Add the following recording rule in a file named `/etc/prometheus/recording_rules.yml` and include it in the Prometheus config

```yaml
groups:
  - name: node_memory
    rules:
      - record: :node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes:sum
        expr: |
          (1 - (
            sum by(instance) (node_memory_MemFree_bytes + node_memory_Cached_bytes + node_memory_Buffers_bytes)
          )
          /
            sum by(instance) (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes))
          * 100
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}

Create the recording rule `recording_rules.yml` with the following command:

```bash
curl -o /etc/prometheus/recording_rules.yml \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/prometheus-training/main/content/en/docs/02/labs/recording_rules.yml
```

We also need to tell Prometheus to consider the new `recording_rules.yml` file, by altering the `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.

```yaml
...
rule_files:
  - "recording_rules.yml"
...
```

We can validate the configuration.

```bash
promtool check config /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

The last thing we need to do is to reload Prometheus.

```bash
sudo systemctl reload prometheus
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

* Add the following recording rule file `training_prometheusrule_avail_memory.yaml` to your monitoring directory, commit and push your changes.

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: prometheusrule-avail-memory
spec:
  groups:
    - name: node_memory
      rules:
        - record: :node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes:sum
          expr: |
            (1 - (
              sum by(instance) (node_memory_MemFree_bytes{instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"}
              +
              node_memory_Cached_bytes{instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"}
              +
              node_memory_Buffers_bytes{instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"}
            )
            )
            /
              sum by(instance) (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"}))
            * 100
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

After configuring the recording rule and reloading the configuration, Prometheus provides those metrics accordingly.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
It may take up to one minute for the recording rule to become available.
{{% /alert %}}

Use your `recording_rule` definition in the expression browser:

```promql
:node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes:sum
```

or hit the following [link](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.thanosquerier %}}/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=%3Anode_memory_MemAvailable_bytes%3Asum)

{{% /details %}}

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
If you take a look at the historical metrics, you will notice that there is no backfilling (by default) of your data. Only data since activation of the recording rule is available. Optional backfilling can be accomplished by using the [`promtool` utility](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#backfilling-for-recording-rules)
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Perhaps you have noticed that the rule name starts with a colon. While this may seem odd at first sight, this is actually the result of following the naming convention mentioned above. The rule does not aggregate over a certain `level` and therefore the first field of `level:metric:operation` remains empty.
{{% /alert %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: CPU utilization recording rule

In this lab you are going to create a CPU utilization recording rule.

* Create a rule to record the **CPU utilization** of your server
* Make sure that Prometheus evaluates this rule every **60 seconds**
* Verify in the web UI that you can query your recording rule

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

As you saw in a previous exercise, the `node_cpu_seconds_total` metric contains the CPU utilization of a node. We can use the `mode` label on this metric to filter for `idle` cpu time.

All other modes than `idle` indicate, that the CPU is used. Therefore we can simply subtract the idle percentage from 100 % and get the value we want.


{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
Add the following recording rule to `/etc/prometheus/recording_rules.yml`:

```yaml
groups:
...
  - name: node_cpu
    interval: 60s
    rules:
      - record: instance:node_cpu_utilisation:rate5m
        expr: |
          100 - (
            avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m]))
            * 100
          )
```

By specifying the `interval`, you can overwrite the default evaluation interval.

Reload Prometheus

```bash
sudo systemctl reload prometheus
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

* Add the following recording rule file `training_recording_rule_cpu_usage.yaml` to your monitoring directory, commit and push your changes.

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: recording-rule-cpu-usage
spec:
  groups:
    - name: node_cpu
      interval: 60s
      rules:
        - record: instance:node_cpu_utilisation:rate5m
          expr: |
            100 - (
              avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle",instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"}[5m]))
              * 100
            )
```
