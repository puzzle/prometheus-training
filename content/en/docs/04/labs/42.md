### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 - Install and configure Pushgateway

First we will add the pre-installed Pushgateway (`localhost:9091`) to our Prometheus instance, later we will use our Pushgateway to add metrics and learn how to remove pushed metrics from the Pushgateway.

Configure Prometheus to scrape the metrics from the Pushgateway

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

Extend the Prometheus `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` as you would to add a common exporter.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  ...
  - job_name: 'pushgateway'
    honor_labels: true
    static_configs:
    - targets:
      - 'localhost:9091'
  ...
```

Reload Prometheus to make changes active

```bash
sudo systemctl reload prometheus
```

You should now see the default metrics exposed by the Pushgetway with the following query:

```promql
{job="pushgateway"}
```

You can also directly navigate to your [Prometheus instance](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.prometheus %}}/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr={job%3D"pushgateway"}&g0.tab=1)

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2 - Push metrics to Pushgateway

In this task you're now going to push metrics to the pushgateway. This is what you would normally do, after a cronjob has completed successfully.
In order to [push](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/blob/master/README.md#command-line) metrics to the Pushgateway, you can simple send a HTTP `POST` or `PUT` request, with the actual metric we want to push as content, to it.

As you have seen earlier the Pushgateway is available under <http://localhost:9091>. When pushing metrics to the Pushgateway you always have to specify the job, therefore the URL Path looks like this

```bash
http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/<JOB_NAME>{/<LABEL_NAME>/<LABEL_VALUE>}
```

If for example we want to push the `prometheus_training_labs_completed_total` metric with the value `4` on the job `prometheus_training`, we can do that by executing the following command:

```bash
echo "prometheus_training_labs_completed_total 4" | curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/prometheus_training
```

Verify the metric in the [Prometheus we UI](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.prometheus %}}/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=prometheus_training_labs_completed_total&g0.tab=1). It may take up to 30s ( Depending on the `scrape_interval`) to be available in Prometheus.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}

If you see the labels `exported_instance` and `exported_job` in the Prometheus expression browser you did not set `honor_labels: true` in the Pushgateway scrape configuration.
{{% /alert %}}

[Push](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/blob/master/README.md#command-line) the following metric (notice the `instance` label) to the Pushgateway and make sure the metric gets scraped by Prometheus

```promql
# TYPE some_metric_total counter
# HELP This is just an example metric.
some_metric_total{job="prometheus_training",instance="myinstance"} 42
```

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

To push a metric to the Pushgateway, which then will be scraped by Prometheus, we can simply use the following `curl` command. Note the actual content of the HTTP request, is just simply the exact metric we want Prometheus to scrape.

Execute the following command to push the metric to your Pushgateway

```bash
cat <<EOF | curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/prometheus_training/instance/myinstance
# TYPE some_metric_total counter
# HELP This is just an example metric.
some_metric_total 42
EOF
```

{{% alert title="Command Explanation" color="primary" %}}
If you are not very familiar with the Linux shell. The above command does the following:

* the `cat` command reads the actual metric and pipes it to `stdin`
* curl sends a HTTP POST request to the url <http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/prometheus_training/instance/myinstance> with the --data-binary parameter set to `stdin` (the actual metric)

Verify the metric in the [Prometheus we UI](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.prometheus %}}/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=some_metric_total&g0.tab=1). It may take up to 30s ( Depending on the `scrape_interval`) to be available in Prometheus.

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3 - Delete Pushgateway metrics

By sending HTTP `delete` requests to the same endpoint, we can delete metrics from the Pushgateway.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Metrics pushed to the Pushgateway are not automatically purged until you manually delete them via the API or the process restarts. If you persist the metrics with `--persistence.file`, you should ensure that you have set up a job that cleans up the metrics on a regular basis.
{{% /alert %}}

According to the [official Pushgateway documentation](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/blob/master/README.md#command-line) you can delete either metrics for specific label combinations (exact match required) or all metrics.

Delete the pushed metrics from the Pushgateway.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Deleting metrics requires the cli option [--web.enable-admin-api](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway#command-line), which we have enabled for you, but which is disabled by default.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

To delete the metrics for the job `prometheus_training`, you can simply execute the following command:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/prometheus_training
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
This will delete metrics with the label set `{job="prometheus_training"}` but not `{job="prometheus_training",another_label="value"}` since the delete methode requires an exact label match.
{{% /alert %}}

With the following command you can delete all metrics:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9091/api/v1/admin/wipe
```
