# How to contribute to our labs

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:


## Did you find a bug

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](/../../issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](/../../issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one

* **Feature Request**: open an issue on GitHub and describe your feature.

* **New Feature**: Implement your Feature on a fork and create a pull request. The core team will gladly check and eventually merge your pull request.


## Do you have questions about the workshop

* Ask your question as an issue on GitHub

Thanks!
